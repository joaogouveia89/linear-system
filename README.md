# Linear System solving algorithms 
Solutions in  Ruby

### Problem description

Solve linear systems in different numeric methods, iterative and non iterative

### Example

3x + 2y + 4z = 1<br/>
x  + y  + 2z = 2<br/>
4x + 3y - 2z = 3<br/>
<br/>
x = -3; y = 5; z = 0<br/>

### Usage

To use you can clone this repo, replace the test-cases/input/input.txt file with your own input.txt file containing the linear system to be handled, or you can edit the existing file with it.

Then navigate to src folder using terminal and run

```bash
ruby linear_system.rb
```

### Input Format

txt file inside test-cases/input folder with the mandatory name input.txt containing linear system in the format of matrix

example with the description matrix
